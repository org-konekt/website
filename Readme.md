        VAANIK is Collaborative. It relies heavily on Messaging.

        Most important is Bar Coding. We highly differ to the point of hate with GS1, UPC Bar Coding Companies. The reason is not Commercial but Everything else. The reasons:

        Getting UPC, GS1 Bar Codes is Expensive. There is also per scan charge.
        Same Item in different packing need different Bar Code.
        Bar Code give STATIC information about a product and it's Manufacturer. (Item can neither be traced nor tracked with Bar Codes.)
        We implemented ours. What? One more Bar Code Systems? But we have no choice. It is Simple, It is Free, It tracks Item from Manufacturer, Resellers to Consumer.

        Payment Aggregation, Payment Processing, Digital Signature infrastructure is in Development.

        Operational Scalability
        Only Software in the World, that can be used by a Housewife, Youngester or a Global Business with Thousands of Operational Centers.

        Sounds unbelievable? We have delivered it. This Software can scale up and down, synchronizing with any Individual's Career, changing Businesses, changing Business needs.

        Functional Scalability
        Personal Finance, Asset Management, Locations and Departments, Profit Centers, Inventory, Before and After Sales Services and Marketing, Logistics, Contract Work, Salaried Job; everything is here.

        And it is well organized.

        A user intuitively knows and manages the Business Organization.

        Intuitive and Simple
        The Software guides you.

        It is much similar to a Video Game, that even a child steers to a Win.

        Who wants to take a Course learning Accounts, Finance and Taxation, if it is INTUITIVE?

        Free from Baggage
        We shed off 400 year old Traditional Accounting Framework.

        General Ledger, Credit/Debit, Voucher Posting, Trial Balance are all gone.

        We implemented a newer REA(Resource, Event, Agent) Accounting framework, based on Computational Business Model, which responds to changes in ways of doing Business.

        Probably we are the FIRST in the World to do this.

        Not just Repackaging into IFRS
        We Implemented IFRS Accounting Standard, but crossed the line by VALIDATING it.

        Our Software doesn't allow fraudful cycles of Circular Trade, Asset Appreciation/Depreciation

        Centralized and Collaborative
        Just like Social Media Platforms, it is a Collaborative B2B-C eCommerce Software.

        You locate a Vendor by product or vicinity. You tweak into his Stock. You place an order and choose Logistics partner. You track your order.

        Did we say Centralized? We will provide Blockchain based Federated Software, once it becomes economical and fast in real-time.

        Automation
        Glitches in Payment and Logistic aggregation? Synoptic Interfaces? Sensors and Trackers?

        We are, for now, restricted and limited by Resources.

        But things will change.

        The promoter of this Software has been an Industrial Automation Engineer. We have vision of the things coming, and their impact on Business.

        We gave you Simplicity, because we worked hard for it. After-all, not everybody in this World is an Accountant or Management Graduate or a Space Scientist.

        Collaborative Business
        LEGACY ERP and General Ledger is getting out of fashion. They worked within closed walls. Didn't talk with another ERPs.

        They had been Heroes of their times, but now they are old. Sure, they tried to change with times, adopted Internet, Email, Bar Code, Business Intelligence, BUT..

        The basic Architecture has not changed with time. Since 1980, it is 100% same across all ERP systems of All Vendors, be them Big or Small. The same employees shift their jobs between SAP, Oracle, Microsoft and Hundreds more. The knowledge is same, highly distilled and refined. One refinement in one ERP Product, percolates through another ERPs into their next Versions.

        For ignorants, this may means Stability, Proven model of Concept, BUT...

        The Technology of doing Business has changed in these years. People expect more.
        ERPs should COLLABORATE actively and automatically. Microsoft-GP of Business A should COLLABORATE with SAP-One of Business B. No Mapping/Messaging Middleware (TIBCO, BizTalk), and Specialists should sit in between.
        ERP Modules (especially HR and Finance) should be Transparent to all Other ERP Modules (including HR and Finance themselves). So do you think, they talk with each others? It is year 2014, and still these Modules are seperate islands of information. NO TRANSPARENCY between ERP MODULES is there in year 2014, let alone out-side!
        These so-called 'MODERN' ERPs 'COMPLY', not 'IMPLEMENT' various Standards. One of them, notably is IFRS.
        Business Automation and REA framework are coming in fashion. VAANIK. It is new, young and capable Business Tool for the new World. But there is more to it.


        IFRS Accounting Standard
        We chose IFRS for SMEs. It is the one and only with us.

        Currently we comply with Section 13 'Inventories' only, out of 33 sections of it, since we have only implemented Inventory Module. But we claim our Inventory Module to be the MOST PERFECT, CONNECTED and TRACEABLE in the World.

        We are developing VAANIK in strict accordance with IFRS in Mind. Many (about 17 Sections) of the Rest 32 Sections of IFRS will be implemented by the end of 2014.

        When we say 'Implemented IFRS', it doesn't mean 'translating' GL Reports to IFRS Standard. We have studied IFRS to it's Soul, and want to 'Provide' the 'Good Parts' of it to the World, in Deeds. XBRL may come in future.

        Collaboration is the KEY!
        Isolation creates problems,
        at least in Business.
        Connectivity does not let them arise, or, at least, solves them.
        Manufacturers, Stockists, Distributors, Retailers, Consumers, Dispatch Agents, Marketing Agents
        Everybody Collaborates here.
        Any Industry, Any Business, Any Individual, Anything that sells.., is Sold here.
        From Corporate Manufacturer to Individual Artisan, the Software is the Same.
        Every movement of every Item and every Penny is recorded and traced with MINIMAL interference.


        What we have here (the cause for failure) is, lack of Communication..
        ..a famous movie quote
        Legacy ERPs have COMMUNICATION problem..
        (They look Arrogant, Narcissists. They work behind iron walls. They even don't 'Talk' with 'Lower' Employees. It is said that they are only 'Responsible' to Top Management. Is it Pride? Is it Fear? Or just PLAIN INCAPABILITY?)

        Lack of COMMUNICATION results in Lack of INTEGRATION
        Supply Chain Management does not become part of Purchase, Sale and other Inventory processes.
        Financial Management does not DISSOLVE into all other ERP Modules. It becomes a seperate Module.
        Employees execute Business Processes, whatever be the ERP Module. But current ERP Modules are only limited to HR and Payroll (Hire, Fire, Training, Attendance, Salary etc.).
        Business Process Management driven by Employees is completely absent.
        Inter-Module communication? Forget about it. ERP Software business has become 30 years old now, and Modules don't communicate with each other. Clerks and Manager do it by passing Document to Other Departments(Marketing, Production, HR etc.). This Document based Work-Flow breaks it's continuity at every Interaction Point.


        REA Accounting Framework
        Note: Traditional(General Ledger, GL) or REA Accounting Frameworks have nothing to do with IFRS or GAAP Accounting Standards. GAAP or IFRS are 'Standards' for nationally or globally portable 'Reporting Systems', which all Business Stake-Holders can understand. Traditional(General Ledger) or REA Accounting Frameworks are the techniques for 'Recording' Business Process. So a parallelism or imaginary resemblance between GAAP or IFRS and GL or REA is there. GAAP or IFRS is the 'Cosmetic' layer, whereas GL or REA is the 'Execution' layer.

        The World has invested heavily in producing Millions of Certified Accountants, Financial Management Professionals and Economists, who have learnt General Ledger. The Software Companies have invested Billions in GL based Software. No one will want this much effort and investment go waste. Besides, implementing REA based Software brings its own challenges.

        Why should we abandon Traditional Accounting Framework based on General Ledger? (Or Why should we migrate on to REA Accounting Framework?)
        GL was used since 400 years for Book-Keeping (before the advent of Computers). It has endured and passed the tests of Time. Business (ERP, Accounting and Finance) Software Vendors ported this concept to Computer. The GL based software too have matured. But, the very way GL works, is unable to cater two requirements arisen from the Business World, with changed Times and Technology:
        Trial Balance and Posting of Records has become unnecessary, since the Computers have become very powerful. But this is a Trivial problem. The big problem is mentioned below.
        All Business Process in every Software tend to converge and distill to GL module. The Management of Business Process has become the opposite requirement. The way GL behaves, leaves Business Software Vendors with two opposite choices: Either go for perfect GL implementation or go for perfect Business PROCESS Management. Note the word 'PROCESS', means something in Transit, that can not be 'Recorded' decisively. GL mandates 'Posted (Recorded decisively)' data.
        GL can NEVER be so perfected to avoid frauds (Cyclic Trade, misappropriation/miscalculation of Asset Valuations, Reserves etc). REA can avoid it.
        VAANIK did it, since it was new and capable. We carry no burden of Past.

        Product Visibility
        Product Visibility gets an special emphasis in VAANIK, since it (lack of it) is the source of most erratic or fraudulent behaviour of existing ERPs. Cyclic Trade is an example. But there are many ways to commit wrong. In VAANIK, we TRACK every product GLOBALLY, till it is consumed or finishes its Shelf Life.
        Smaller Manufacturers, Craftsmen, Artists get visibility Globally.
        A consumer knows the ORIGIN of product. So the Duplicate product are recognized in this process. Consumer can compare multiple products of the same genre. A consumer can find a product in a shop nearest to him/her. Payment Aggregation and VISIBLE (and economic and quick) logistics is on the cards.
        A manufacturer knows about the where-abouts of his Product at any instance of time and the Consumers who buy them. Loyal Consumers can be rewarded, educated. New products can be launched smoothly. Product feedback gets genuine, cheap and automatic. Business Intelligence becomes perfect. Recalling, Stop-Selling is possible.
        A free Product Browser software is for EVERYBODY. Images are supported. Substitute/Alternative Products can be looked up. Remarks from other Consumers are there. Product information is provided by Manufactures themselves, so is more reliable.


        ##### Acknowledgement
        We provide full support for EMails to be used as Acknowledgements, since EMails are reliable, mature and stable Messaging Protocol implementation.

        PDFs are supported partially, for Business Processes, which have the potential to become legally disputable.

        Acknowledgements are automatically generated, stored and despached to recipient. The user do not have to make extra effort to do it on his behalf.

        ##### Digital Signature
        A Digital Signature can be attached to a PDF Document. There is no need to attach a Digital Signature to EMails and Images.

        Our clients should get a Digital Signature from any Signing Authority by themselves, and then submit it to our Key Store.

        ##### Document Management System
        Following Document formats are supported
        - Images
        - EMails
        - PDFs

        Documents can be attached to:

        Business Participients (e.g. Customer, Employee, Product, Bank, Project etc.)
        Business Processes (e.g. Purchase, Monetary Transaction etc.)

        Image as Document:

        Any paper that is captured through scanner or camera is a document. Vouchers, Bills, Photographs, Finger Prints also can be stored.

        Email as Document

        We provide Mail Ids from our Mail Server.
        External Mail Ids (suche as GMail, HotMail, Yahoo etc.) can not be used because, we can not control them, and so, process them.
        No attachements are permitted, since the Email Body contains all requisite business data.
        Email body is a Valid XML text, auto-generated, viewed and parsed through our software.
        EMail body is designed to describe the unique business process. It's Data strictly follows our format. Yes, the layout (visual representation) may be chosen by the users.

        PDF as Document

        Only ONE software generated PDF is attached to a Business Process.
        We are going to provide Multiple, Cascaded Digital Signatures to be attached to our PDFs. This will create Legal value for a Business Process.

        ##### IFRS and XBRL
        Yes, we do it. We implement 'IFRS for SMEs' guidelines released in 2013.

        Reporting for Individual Profit Centre and Consolidate Reports for whole business are provided.

        We go even further, since IFRS alone can not stop unscrupulous people to do Manipulative Accounting
        We provide centralized repository of Products, Businesses and their Bank Accounts.

        All Businesses registered with us have their Monetary Channels registered with us. So it can be tracked whether more than one businesses use Same Bank Account.

        The biggest pain point with any Accounting System is diagnosing Cyclic Trade. You can sniffs cyclic trade by tracking (a request to be made with us) Profitability of some Business Partner, kind of products and services it deals with, and it's allegiance with other Businesses.

        ##### Monetary Transactions
        All ISO currencies are supported, since our platform is Globally Collaborative.

        We have integrated VISA and MASTER cards. We wish to integrate as many Payment Gateways and Financial Institutions as possible, even if they may be Country specific.

        Being colloborative, everybody pays. Receiving is automatic.
        When your Customer pays through a Monetary Channel (obviously against a Business Process), the Payment automatically gets attached to respective Business Process.
        All you have to do is just watch the Acknowledgement about the Money coming in.

        ##### POS AutomationView in Action APIs
        We support Bar Code and ATM Cards only. But we are trying, that the support should be complete.

        You get Product Information and Manufacturer Information, as you get them using GS1.

        With our Bar Code implementation, But there is more..
        More specific product information like Batch Number, Manufacturing Date, Shelf Life can also be seen.
        You can check authenticity of your product.
        We support GS1 Bar Coding completely. But if you don't have GS1 code, or don't want to pay for GS1 registrations and scans, we give you our Bar Code, which is Free.

        ATM Card support
        You have to register your ATM card or Online Banking Credentials (except password or PIN) with us.

        RFID Tags
        Support is planned in future.

        ##### Statutory Compliances
        VAT/GST reports.
        Every item is uniquely and individually tracked for its VAT filing or re-imbursement. It provides complete control and perfection of VAT/GST calculation.

        VAT/GST for every country is being implemented.

        Income Tax rpeorts
        Income Tax returns can be controlled completely, only when we implement Asset Repository in Collaborative way. Till then, all Asset/Liability calculation will be in Good Faith.

        ##### Buy from Manufacturer directly
        If the Manufacturer is willing to sell directly to Consumers, ConnecTRADE facilitates it.
        Then, you can buy from Manufacturer, simply, as you buy from a Retailer, online.
        The benefits may be a Discounted Price.
        The main thing is, ConnecTRADE lets you know, if some product is available to be buyed from a Manufacturer, when you want to buy that product. This facilitation was extermely difficult (nearly impossible) till now.

        ##### Check Genuinity of the Product
        Now that the Product is in your(The Consumer's) Hands...
        You want to check if it is Genuine or not.
        There is an Individual Product Code printed on the Wrapper, somewhere. (It is the Manufacturer's decision, how to print it, highlight it and how long to keep the Code.)
        The Code is visible to everybody. There is no stopping to anybody producing a fake Product and a same code printed on a genuine Product.
        You(The Consumer) now use the Software provided by ConnecTRADE and enter the Code.
        It simply shows the following data: The Seller who sold you the Product, the Manufacturer who produced it. If you see the Manufacturer's name, it is a Genuine Product.
        Remember:
        A fake product is the product that is introduced in the middle of the Supply-Chain. Some unscrupulous Trader has first introduced it in the Supply Chain.
        A fake product won't trace to a Manufacturer.
        It is 100% possibility that more than on Product have been sold with the Same Individual Product Code. As soon as another Product is sold, the Manufacturer comes to know about it.


        ##### Compare Products
        For products of daily need:
        You know which one to buy. You can also test new products without a Hitch. You don't care if you didn't like a product. Buying new(used for the first time) products fills you in excitement, so you buy it. No problem. Just a routine way of life.

        But sometimes, you become highly choosy. The reasons:
        Product is Expensive.
        You are sentimental about it. (e.g. Cosmetics, Medicine)
        You have to use the product for the long run.
        There is unique quality in the product, you are searching for (but maybe you don't believe the Manufacturer and want to get the feedbacks from actual users).
        We provide Product Search Software, where you can find:
        Alternatives for a Product
        All Product Specifications directly from the Manufacturer's Desk.
        Feedbacks from Real Users about it.

        ##### Find a store, which is having a Specific Product
        Case: You want to buy a rare product, not every Retailer keeps.
        What you do Traditionally:
        Go to every store and ask about it. No help
        Ask every Retailers where you can find it. No Idea
        Search Google:
        You got it. Only 1000 Miles away, some Store sells it. It takes only One Week to deliver. At least.. Finally.., you got it.
        We are your Google inside the Stores. Trust us.
        You may find your product in a nearby Store, you could not Imagine, using ConnecTRADE.

        ##### Get Loyalty Rewards
        Retail Outlets provide Loyalty Rewards. Mostly, it is in the form of Discount Coupons.
        But Consumers are Loyal to certain Manufacturers and their products, not the Retail Stores.
        Only ConnecTRADE let Manufacturers know that you(the Consumer) buy their products.
        The Result: You(the Consumer) are not tied to a particular Retail Store. You can buy anywhere. Manufacturer comes to know about it.

        Remember: The Manufacturers are more inclined to offer you Loyalty Rewards and are more capable in doing so.

        ##### Make Remark about a Product
        And make honest remarks about a Product. Your remarks are valueable.
        Manufacturers come to know about the Consumer Feedback about a Product. This save them a lot of Market-Survey Effort, Time and Money.

        Other wannabe Consumers read it. They can make informed decision about buying a Product.

        ##### Payment Aggregator Service
        Most Consumers use Cash. Getting Smaller Denominations is really a problem. You have to buy some petty things to take your bill to a Round Figure.

        Problem Worsens when you use Electronic Cash: Most Bankers discourage purchases having small amounts.

        Remember: Neither Retailers nor Banks are going to change their ways for you.
        We bring Payment Aggregator Service. You end up paying little more (Upto Round Figures). After your payments exceed some Big amount(Depends on the Country), the accumulated cash is transferred to your Account.

        ##### Receive Small Purchases at Home
        In countries like India, China etc., logistics is cheap because of high population density.
        So our logistics model should work. We see lot of Courier-boys supplying inter-city couriers for as low as 10 US Cents (Catch: In Urban areas only).

        How to get Purchase at home:
        When you place order and it is approved, you have the option of choosing a familiar Courier Service. Familiarity with a Courier Service happens over time. Initially, it is a Trial and Error method.
        If you are unable to decide a Courier Agent, ask your Supplier to choose a proper one.
        As soon as a Courier Agent is chosen, you come to know about his name and phone number.
        So call him, trace him.
        Most online eCommerce services in India are only able to provide Door Delivery, begining at nearly 1 US Dollar. The reason being the Corporate Nature of these Companies. We try to avoid these Companies and rather prefer unorganized local Courier Agents.

        ##### Calculation of Charging
        We provide standard and efficient way of charging. A customer knows, he is not OVER-CHARGED or UNDER-SERVICED. It increases customer satisfaction and trust.
        It depends on the following factors:
        Intermediate Packet handling points
        Distance
        Weight and Volume
        Number of packages handled simultaneously
        distance of return trip, which ie empty handed.

        ##### Logic Involved
        Logistics is a business carried out on streets. Whether you provide deliveries by walking or through 4-wheelers, you need ease of handling of information. Smart-Phones are the most handy business tools for you. We provide our Logistic solution for Smart-Phones.

        Logistics business is very tricky. You, as a Logistic Provider, operate within a certain Geographic region, and therefore can not provide End-to-end Logistic services all the time.

        All solutions can not be provided on Softwares. Intermediate Collection Points and Delivery Points have to be arranged on ground. Similarly, planning logistics service based on most optimistic route, charging fee according to distance, weight and volume of packing, number of packages handled simultaneously, distance of return empty-handed journey is complicated.

        We provide solution for it. (We hope, someday, Public Transport Services will also benefit from our solution.)

        ##### Multicast your Status
        ConnecTRADE allows logistic provider to reveal his where-abouts to the Customers, whose packages he is carrying in that specific trip.

        ##### Bar Coding: Our Way
        GS1 provides global Bar Coding. A lot of Manufacturers (GS1 says 200,000 Globally) have registered their products with GS1. We assume most are Corporates.

        But 99.5% of businesses are Small to Medium Enterprises, which can not afford to pay the Small (Hundreds of Thousands Dollars) amount to GS1 for getting Barcodes.

        We provide our own Bar Code implementation. We do not create our own standard. We provide Bar Codes as per GS1 Standards. The only thing is Bar Codes provided by us will not be found in GS1 Bar Code Repository.

        Let us understand it through a sketch
        Bar Code
        GS1 is preferred where GS1 data is available.
        ConnecTRADE is used where GS1 is not available.
        If later, GS1 data for any product becomes available, ConnecTRADE will be replaced by GS1 for that product.
        We don't want to push ConnecTRADE. It is there just to fill the vacuum (Cater Enterprises that can not afford GS1).
        ConnecTRADE follows the same standards and norms that GS1 follows. No different logic is applied.
        ConnecTRADE is imperative for now:
        GS1 registration is costly (in Third-World Country's context). ConnecTRADE is FREE. Small manufacturers, craftsmen, artists can NEVER afford getting GS1 barcodes.

        ##### Change MRP on the Fly
        Changing (mostly incrementing) MRP of a Product does not help you monetarily, if you already have sold the Product.

        But it helps, when you maintain Franchise business or keep the ownership of the product with you in the Supply-Chain.

        ##### Product Catalog
        As a manufacture, you have the priviledge/Responsibility of:

        Adding, Modifyig Product Information, Dis-continuing a Product.
        Obtaining GS1 Global Barcodes or get Barcode from us.
        Decide if product is available to Consumers(End-Users) for buying.
        Adding new Batches(after Production), to a Product.
        Setting Individual Product Code for each Item.
        Moving your products to Warehouses or C/F agents, after they are produced. Only then they(your physical products) become visible to your Buyers.

        ##### Read Remarks about a Product
        We know, you value your Product in Esteem
        But what the Consumers say about your Product, Read it in our Software.
        It saves you Market Survey Efforts, Money and further loss of Reputation.

        We don't let you delete or moderate any Remark. But any malicious remark can be removed or moderated by us on your request.

        ##### Recall a Product or Stop-Selling a Batch
        Since you can trace the where-abouts of an Item, you can:
        Recall items:
        When the Shelf-life of an Item expires.
        When there is some Defect in an Item.
        Stop selling an item:
        Sometimes Authorities want it.

        ##### Replenish Client Stores
        You know how many products are currently available with any Trader. Do something about this information.
        This information helps you push the sales.

        ##### Set individual Product Code
        Let us explain you the Process:
        Suppose,
        -->You(the Manufacturer) produce 20 pieces of Luxury Pens.
        -->Every Pen has GS1 Barcode printed on it, which is always the same for each pen.
        -->You print visible random (but unique for that production Batch) text on each pen. Everybody can see it.
        -->You map each random text to some another text, that only you know. Note: Even we at ConnecTRADE do not know about this mapping. We only provide the pointer for reaching there.

        How it helps in reality
        A consumer buys one of these Pen. He wants to check if the Pen is authentic or not. He just SMS the text to ConnecTRADE.
        If the pen is genuine, you will come to know about it.
        If the pen is fake (introduced at some point in the middle of the supply-chain), he will come to know about it. The Manufacturer also comes to know about it. The Manufacturer also comes to know, at what point in the Supply-Chain, the fake pen was introduced.

        ##### Trace your products
        Here is how it works:
        -> You made a product ProductA
        -> Some Trader named Trader1 bought it.

        ##### Getting Rewarded Properly
        We know it is tough getting customer. It is tougher to seal a deal.

        If you work for an full-fledged, established Enterprise, charging commissions are not an issue.
        Problems arise when you want to cross the line and get open to the world. In this case, how will you know that a Customer you referenced has executed a purchase, from which outlet? Lack of information (and timely information) and transparency, will affect your earnings and reputation.

        ##### Avoid Circular Trade
        This is how Circular Trade works:
        The term Circular Trade is borrowed from Stock Trading Business. At least Two Traders are involved, but more than Two Traders do even better. Trader1 sells Stock(Inventory in our case) to Trader2 for no apparent Profit. Trader2 now sells to Trader1 for no apparent profit. So the Turnover of both the Traders is increased, but no resulting profit is registered.
        Now go one step Deeper. Both Traders make no resulting profit, but a shrewed interpretation of Bad Debts, Accounts Receivables, Accounts Payables and Asset Valuations marks the respective Business more Profitable as it really is. Now the Profits justifies Trade Balance. This Strong Financial Balance-Sheet is used to lure Investments from Banks or Public. This is a Fraudulant activity.

        This is why Legacy ERPs can not stop it with IFRS Accounting System:
        There is Great difference between 'Compiling data and Showing IFRS Reports' and 'Implementing IFRS'. Legacy ERPs Show Off. No Legacy ERP stops its Accountants to feed wrong data. Any data can be manipulated.

        Why ConnecTRADE is able to stop Circular Trade:
        On the contrary, ConnecTRADE is able to 'Implement IFRS'. It prevents stocks to be sold on 'Purchase Price' or on Loss. It differentiates between Bad Debts and Receivables. It prevents Asset to be valued on Whims. All these things happen because of the Collaborative nature of ConnecTRADE, which mandates REAL involvement of Two Businesses to Execute a Business Process along with Centralized Tracking of Business Processes.

        Remember:
        ConnecTRADE, or any Authority, can not stop two Businesses to Buy and Sell indefinitely. They are free to do it. Obviously, their Turnovers will increase. But ConnecTRADE ensures, one Business Profits at the Loss of other. So the Benefits of Circular Trade diminish.


        ##### Orders placed by Buyers
        Work-flow:
        Before approving an Order
        The decision to approve an Order needs two Feedbacks:

        You, as Supplier, can fulfill the Order.
        You and the Buyer agree to pay money within a agreed-upon date. The scheduled Payment is fed into the Software and Executes automatically on the Scheduled date.
        (No worries to you, as the Payment is Guaranteed, if the Buyer is not Defaulted) This is an excellent benefit of a Collaborative Software.
        You approved the order. Then,
        You handle Ordered Products to a Dispatch Agent. .
        You get Acknowledgement when the Inventory is received by the Buyer.


        ##### Orders placed to Suppliers
        Work-flow:
        Before placing an Order
        You create an Order.
        You can place an Order, only if Supplier approves it. You come to know by SMS if an Order is approved or rejected.
        If an Order is rejected, you can forward it to another Supplier.
        The decision to approve an Order needs two Feedbacks:

        The Supplier can fulfill the Order.
        You and Supplier agree to pay money within a agreed-upon date. The scheduled Payment is fed into the Software and Executes automatically on the Scheduled date.
        (No worries for a Supplier, Payment is Guaranteed, if payee is not Defaulted) This is an excellent benefit of a Collaborative Software.
        Let us suppose, that Supplier has approved your Order. Then,

        After placing an Order
        You can see if, your order is handled to a Dispatch Agent. You comes to know the name of the Dispatch Agent, so you can track the Order.
        You can Cancel/Change the Order, if it is not handled to a Dispatch Agent.
        You can pay money against an Order in Full or in Parts. Payment Balances can be tracked Supplier-wise or Order-wise.
        Acknowledge, after you receive your Order.

        All Business Process in every Software tend to converge and distill to GL module.
        The Management of Business Process has become the opposite requirement.
        The way GL behaves, leaves Business Software Vendors with two opposite choices:
        Either go for perfect GL implementation.
        Or go for perfect Business PROCESS Management.
        Note the word 'PROCESS', means something in Transit, that can not be 'Recorded' decisively. GL mandates 'Posted (Recorded decisively)' data.
        GL can NEVER be so perfected to avoid frauds (Cyclic Trade, misappropriation/miscalculation of Asset Valuations, Reserves etc).
        REA can avoid it.
