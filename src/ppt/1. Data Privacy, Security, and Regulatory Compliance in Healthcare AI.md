### Slide 9: Data Sovereignty
    - Data sovereignty refers to digital data that is subject to the laws of the country in which it is located.
    - The increasing adoption of cloud data services and a perceived lack of security has led many countries to introduce new legislation that requires data to be kept within the country in which the customer resides.
    - Current concerns surrounding data sovereignty are related to governments trying to prevent data from being stored outside the geographic boundaries of the originating country. Ensuring that data exists only in the host country can be complex and often relies on the detail provided in the Service Level Agreement with the Cloud Service Provider.
    - Do Governments want to control Data, Manipulate outcomes, profit from data?
